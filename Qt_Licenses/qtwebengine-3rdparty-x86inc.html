; This is a header file for the x264ASM assembly language, which uses
; NASM/YASM syntax combined with a large number of macros to provide easy
; abstraction between different calling conventions (x86_32, win64, linux64).
; It also has various other useful features to simplify writing the kind of
; DSP functions that are most often used in x264.

; Unlike the rest of x264, this file is available under an ISC license, as it
; has significant usefulness outside of x264 and we want it to be available
; to the largest audience possible.  Of course, if you modify it for your own
; purposes to add a new feature, we strongly encourage contributing a patch
; as this feature might be useful for others as well.  Send patches or ideas
; to x264-devel@videolan.org .</pre></div>
